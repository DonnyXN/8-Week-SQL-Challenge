### B. Data Analysis Questions

**1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?**

```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id)) AS customer_count
FROM 
	foodie_fi.subscriptions
```
![Alt text](image-9.png)

| customer_count|
| ------------- |
| 1000          |

**2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value**

```sql
SELECT 
	DATE_PART('MONTH', sub.start_date) AS month_date,
	TO_CHAR(sub.start_date, 'Month') AS month,
	COUNT(sub.customer_id)
FROM
	foodie_fi.plans p
JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions sub ON p.plan_id = sub.plan_id
WHERE sub.plan_id = '0'
GROUP BY month_date, month
ORDER BY month_date ASC
```

| month_date | month     | count |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| 1          | January   | 88    |
| 2          | February  | 68    |
